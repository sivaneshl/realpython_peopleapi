# Create the SQLAlchemy database instance
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
# This initializes SQLAlchemy by passing the app configuration information just set. The db variable is whatâ€™s imported
# into the build_database.py program to give it access to SQLAlchemy and the database. It will serve the same purpose
# in the server.py program and people.py module.

# Initialize Marshmallow
ma = Marshmallow(app)
# This initializes Marshmallow and allows it to introspect the SQLAlchemy components attached to the app. This is why
# Marshmallow is initialized after SQLAlchemy.
